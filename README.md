## HTML and Css Assignment by Ineuron.

Here i merged all the repository of 3  tailwind  css projects. through this readme file in this repository.


## Technology Used.

## Repository are different for each project.
I am sorry to say that i didn't checkout the assignment section in dashboard. Previously i have submitted the assignment through google form. Therefore i created a single repository for this tailwind css assignment.
